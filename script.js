// using the given information I can create two variables that are immutable and underneath the declared variables I will create a function 
const PI = 3.1415;
const radius = 5;
// const area = PI * radius * radius;
// i calculated the area in meters of the space with the equation and info that was given and decided to make the variable area a number instead of the equation 
const area = 78.54
// created a variable for minimum space for plants 
const minimumSpace = 0.8
let plants = 20;

//to determine the area that the plants need 
let week1 = plants * minimumSpace
let week2 = (week1 * 2);
let week3 = (week2 * 2);

console.log()

let week1space = (week1 / area) * 100;
let week2space = (week2 / area) * 100;
let week3space = (week3 / area) * 100;
